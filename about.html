        <p>Hi there! I'm Baylee Peterson, currently a student at Fort Hays State University. I'm working towards earning my Bachelor's degree in Informatics with a focus in Web Development. Alongside my degree, I'm also completing certificates in Full Stack Web Development and Marketing. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in both the technical and creative aspects of web development.</p>
        <p>For over two years, I've been working as a freelance graphic designer. During this time, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from website creation to designing logos, advertisements, custom t-shirt designs, videos, and full streaming graphics. This diverse experience has honed my skills and allowed me to deliver high-quality, visually appealing, and functional designs tailored to meet my clients' needs.</p>
        <p>Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, as well as traveling to find good views, and indulging in my love for music. Whether I'm enjoying the views I find or dancing my way through my favorite artist's concert, I find inspiration in the world around me. This balance between work, study, and personal interests keeps me grounded and fuels my creativity.</p>
        <p>My passion for design and technology drives me to continuously learn and improve. I take great pride in my ability to bring my clients' visions to life, whether it's through a sleek new website or a captivating logo. I'm excited to continue growing in this field and to take on new challenges that allow me to combine my technical expertise with my creative flair.</p>
